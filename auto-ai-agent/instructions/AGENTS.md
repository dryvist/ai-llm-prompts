# AI Agents Configuration

## Coding behavior

Identity and posture: `soul.md`. Use evidence, make reasonable assumptions, proceed, and surface only
assumptions/tradeoffs that affect action. Ship the simplest surgical fix matching existing style; define
verifiable success criteria, use the narrowest proof, and report exactly what passed/failed. Fix every
warning, error and lint finding for real; never silence, skip or bypass the check that raised it.

Tool choice — **no new custom scripts**. Stop at the first rung that works:
(1) existing flags, config, or an installed skill, command, plugin or MCP server; (2) a native platform or tool
feature; (3) a maintained third-party tool; (4) community content (collections, modules, presets,
hooks, Actions); (5) prior art: `/github-code-search` (thousands of hits is idiomatic, three is a
mistake), context7, registries; (6) a standardized public repo. Only then write code, naming why each rung failed;
delete or replace an existing script before editing it.

Git workflow: never edit on the default branch — start a worktree with `git town hack`. `develop` default branch →
[git-flow](agentsmd/rules/on-demand/git-flow.md): PRs target `develop` (squash-merge), `develop` → `main` by
merge commit only. Otherwise trunk flow. Always **atomic commits**, one fix/feature/section per commit. Load
the on-demand rule for the activity — `rule-tiers.md` is the index. Instruction-behavior changes are `feat:`/`fix:`,
never `docs:`.

Writing voice: prose a person will read follows `~/.agents/voice.md` when that file exists.

Knowledge base: documentation follows [Open Knowledge Format](agentsmd/rules/on-demand/okf.md) — search before
editing, capture new knowledge after a change.

## Where things get written (routing law, no exceptions)

Once questions are resolved and the plan approved, execute end to end in one shot, routed per this table.
GitHub is public, **pull requests only**; a PR body states WHAT the code does — never why, what was
broken, or what's still weak.

| Content | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| Incidents, outages, security findings, weaknesses | the incident tracker |
| Private documentation, especially secret management | the private docs site |
| Everything else, including side quests and follow-ups | the task tracker — **never a GitHub issue** |

The operator's role map names each product ([example](agentsmd/docs/tool-role-map.example.md)).

Never put an incident narrative, security finding, credential/secret detail, unprovisioned identity, internal
topology, host name, or outage timeline in a GitHub issue, PR, comment, or commit message — "side quest" is
not an exemption.

Repo boundaries: `dryvist/ai-llm-prompts` `auto-ai-agent/instructions` (rules, `AGENTS.md`, workflows),
`dryvist/nix-claude-code` `data/permissions` (tool permissions), `dryvist/claude-code-plugins` (commands,
skills, agents, hooks).

**Delegation routing (binding, the only routing statement).** Route each delegated task to the first rung that qualifies.
Check `codex-quota` first.

1. **Codex**, while `codex-quota` exits 0. Pick the model by class:
   - bulk, reads and triage: Luna `xhigh`.
   - bulk work that is still somewhat complicated: Luna `max`.
   - auth, secrets, router, memory and cluster work: Luna `max`. Name `[class: bulk-complex]` in the description.
   - standard implementation: Terra `medium`.
   - complex work, plan, and design or architecture review: Terra `high`.
   Never Terra above `high`, never Luna above `max`.
2. **zcode-job sandbox**, while Codex is capped. Coding tasks only. Public repos qualify. A private repo qualifies only when
   it has the repo property `ai-untrusted-ok=true` and its payload passes classification before dispatch. The output is a
   ready PR labelled `human:review`. Leak-scan it before merge. Never auto-merge it.
3. **Z.ai GLM**, then **OpenCode Go**, while Codex is capped.
4. **Haiku `xhigh`**, the last resort, only when rungs 1 to 3 do not qualify.

Never Sonnet, Opus, or Fable subagents. Never send secrets, credentials, inventory, or incident content to any executor.
Antigravity (`agy`, Gemini 3.8 Flash) is a second-opinion reviewer, not an executor. Use it on high-risk diffs in public or
trusted repos; its call is in the `jpe-ai-delegation` plugin's `delegation-ladder` skill. The Codex CLI procedure is in
[model-delegation.md](agentsmd/rules/on-demand/model-delegation.md). That plugin's skill and hook implement this order.
