# Data pipeline

## Hub-first

Route observability data through a shared hub. Use sources and native transforms
already available there before adding another collector.

## Fan-out

Send each source to every destination that supports its format. Avoid
source-specific destinations; use a single-destination route only when a
documented constraint requires it. Preserve duplicate feeds so destinations
can be compared; repair a failing route instead of removing it.

## Dashboards

Build dashboard entity sets from configuration, not returned series. Show a
missing series as stale with its age, then as no data since its last value; never
hide it.
