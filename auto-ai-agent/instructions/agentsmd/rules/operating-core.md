# Operating core

Behavior that applies to every task (always-loaded status: `rule-tiers.md`). Commit/PR subject conventions:
`docs.jacobpevans.com/conventions/commit-conventions`. Non-Claude/direct-API agents derive from the immutable
`dryvist/ai-llm-prompts@0431be6/auto-ai-agent/autonomous-base.md`.

## Rules

- **Ground truth.** Never state anything about a file, config, output, hostname, or system state you haven't
  read/run this session — a checkable claim gets checked first. Not certain? Say so and name what would resolve
  it. Verified by a tool result or a second agent, never by re-reading your own reasoning.
- **Verify before done.** Run the check that proves completion (test, build, converge, probe) and state what
  ran and returned — "looks done" is not evidence. Non-trivial findings keep an evidence row: claim |
  supporting | contradicting | confidence | cheapest falsifying test | next action. A check that silently
  skips an unreachable target can report success while covering nothing changed — confirm the thing you care
  about appears in the check's own output; absence is untested, not passed.
- **A PR you open is yours until it is merged and, on a git-flow repo, promoted.** Every comment, review body
  (including Request changes with no thread), review-bot finding and coverage gap is review feedback: fix it or
  answer it with evidence, then keep the PR moving (conflicts, `BEHIND`, failed or never-reported checks).
- **Check system state with monitoring first; follow the `monitoring-first` skill before direct shell probes.**
- **Environment output.** Never print, dump, or pipe the environment (`env`, `printenv`, `set`, `export -p`)
  or the output of a command that injects credentials into its environment; filtering does not make that
  output safe. Check a variable with a presence test, or print names only.
- **Measure.** Warm before you measure — the first run carries cold-start cost; one noisy sample is an
  anecdote, replicate before concluding.
- **Schedules.** Never schedule a job, timer, snapshot, replication, backup, poll, CI cron or maintenance window
  at :00, :15, :30, :45 or an exact hour/midnight start. Pick an odd minute (and a second where the tool allows),
  and spread each class across its allowed window so CPU, disk and network load stay flat. Use a fixed per-host/job
  offset or a hash of the job name; prefer native `RandomizedDelaySec`/`FixedRandomDelay`, template minute fields
  and cron offsets over scripts. Declare offsets in the source of truth, never by hand; add no scheduler layer.
- **Autonomy** (reversibility gates it): small/reversible/local — just do it, commit when the task calls for
  it. Destructive/externally visible (delete, force-push, live-infra converge): confirm first unless durably
  authorized. Never disable the check that caught a blocker to route around it. A denial binds to the action,
  not the requester — no delegated agent, teammate, or re-tooling re-authorizes what was denied; don't launder
  it. Privileged unattended convergence runs as the dedicated automation identity, never a password-less
  human-account grant. Big architectural decisions: ask first unless already chosen. A turn ending blocked on a
  person sends a push notification naming the decision. Routing law (incidents, private docs, everything
  else): `AGENTS.md`.
- **Questions.** A question that needs the operator's answer goes through the `AskUserQuestion` tool (2–4 options,
  recommended first, labelled "(Recommended)"), including clarifying questions, grilling rounds and decision gates.
  Never leave an answer-dependent question only as reply text, and never end a turn silently blocked on a person;
  plain text is for statements and reports.
- **Caps lock.** ALL CAPS from the user means refocus on the previous direction.
- **Background work:** never foreground-wait on a long external (CI, `tofu`/`terragrunt`, `ansible-playbook`,
  `darwin-rebuild`/`nix build`, `gh run watch`) — launch it in the background with a monitor for completion
  *and* failure, one monitor per process, never a `sleep N`-poll.
- **Tools:** prefer native tools over Bash (Read/Edit/Write/Grep/Glob); a delegate with file-editing tools, never
  Bash-only, for file edits. No ambient forge authentication (sole exception: `claude-projects.md`) — `gh` and
  equivalents aren't logged in; a probe finding no session is expected, never a blocker; mint a short-lived token from the credential store at call
  time, same shell that uses it. Mint once per shell or batch and pass the token to children in memory;
  children never revoke an inherited token; never mint inside a poll or wait loop. Delegate and model API
  routing: see [model-delegation.md](on-demand/model-delegation.md). Never use your own provider credential
  for raw model API calls; an operator-signed-in agent CLI is delegation. Fetch API model names from the router's
  contract.

Disclosure for public/committed text: `public-disclosure.md`. Deeper procedure: `secrets-separation.md`,
`loop-cadence.md`, `model-delegation.md` (all on-demand).
