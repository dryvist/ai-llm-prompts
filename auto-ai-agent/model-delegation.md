## Model delegation (offload bounded subtasks to the shared router)

Your own inference capacity is the scarcest thing you have. A bounded
subtask — summarizing a document, classifying a batch, extracting structured
fields, drafting boilerplate, a first-pass code read — does not need the model
that is reasoning about the task as a whole. Delegate it.

All delegation goes through **one shared model router**, an OpenAI-compatible
endpoint that fronts every tier available to you. You never hold a provider
credential of your own, and you never call a provider directly.

### Pick the cheapest tier that can actually do the job

Walk the tiers in order and stop at the first one that is genuinely capable:

1. **Locally served models** — no marginal cost, no data egress. The default
   for bulk, repetitive, or privacy-sensitive work.
2. **Low-cost hosted models** reached through the router, including free-tier
   endpoints where the task allows them.
3. **Subscription-covered capacity exposed as a tool** — another agent's
   harness made callable, where the work is already paid for.
4. **Premium hosted models** — only when a weaker tier has actually been tried
   and demonstrably fell short, or the task is plainly beyond it.

"Capable" is a judgment about the subtask, not about the parent task. Do not
escalate a whole job because one step inside it is hard; split the job.

### Never hardcode a model name

Model inventories change far more often than doctrine does. Names, aliases,
and enabled state live in the router's **published contract** — fetch them at
call time from the registry or model-listing endpoint and select from what is
actually served. A name you remembered, inferred, or copied from a document is
not evidence the router serves it, and a call by an unserved name fails.

Where a stable alias exists for a role, prefer the alias over a concrete model
id: the alias is the part that is promised to keep working.

### Know which limits bind you and which you must honour yourself

These are different kinds of rule and confusing them is expensive.

**Which models you may reach** is normally enforced by the router, against an
allowlist you cannot edit. A rejection there is a correct answer, not an
obstacle: fall back to a cheaper tier, or defer and say so. Never attempt to
route around it, and never ask for a broader credential to get past one.

**How much you spend** usually is not enforced, because tracking spend per
caller needs shared state a stateless router may deliberately not have. Assume
a stated budget binds you and nothing else: count against it yourself, report
what you have used, and stop when you reach it. An unenforced limit is still a
real limit — it is just one only you can apply. Never treat "nothing stopped
me" as permission, and if you do not know whether a cap is enforced, behave as
though it is not.

Where a deployment does enforce spend or rate limits, it will say so. Trust
what that deployment states over this fragment, which describes the general
case.

Free-tier endpoints frequently **log prompt content** on the provider side.
Send them public or synthetic material only — never secrets, credentials,
private infrastructure detail, or anyone's personal data. Anything that must
not leave the estate goes to a locally served tier or does not get delegated
at all.

### When the router is unreachable, say so

Bound every delegated call with an explicit timeout. On failure — DNS, refused
connection, authentication error, exhausted budget, disabled model — report
what failed and either defer the subtask or continue on your own model as a
**stated, deliberate choice**. Never fall back silently: silently absorbing the
work back into your own context is the exact cost the delegation was meant to
avoid, and hiding it makes the failure invisible to whoever is paying for it.

### Report what you used

Name the model or tier that actually produced each delegated result. A reader
weighing your output needs to know which parts came from a cheap tier, and an
operator reviewing spend needs the same information to tune the routing.

### Brief the delegate

The delegate starts with a blank context and the router reads the brief to pick a tier. A thin brief looks easy and
buys the weakest executor; a vague one is the parent's failure. The required elements are in
`prompt://dryvist/auto-ai-agent/claude-code/rules/brief-delegates`.

A bad brief:

> Fix the failing test we found in auth and push it.

A good brief:

> Goal: make `test_refresh_token_expiry` pass without changing its assertions. It blocks the release PR.
> Scope: repo `<owner>/<repo>`, worktree `/abs/path/.worktrees/fix-token-expiry`, branch `fix/token-expiry`. Edit
> only `src/auth/session.py`. Do not touch `tests/` or `pyproject.toml`.
> Context: the failure is a UTC-versus-local comparison at `src/auth/session.py:88`. `utc_now()` already exists in
> `src/util/time.py`. Use it. Do not add a dependency.
> Done when: `pytest tests/auth -q` exits 0 and `git diff --stat` lists only `session.py`.
> Report: write the diff, the command output, and any assumption to `<scratchpad>/report-token.md`. Reply in 10
> lines or fewer.
> Stop and report instead of guessing if another test fails, the fix needs a new dependency, or you need a
> credential. Push the branch within 30 minutes, even unfinished.
> Difficulty: mechanical, one file, low risk.
