# Git flow

Repos use the git-flow branch model. [Git Town](https://www.git-town.com) starts,
syncs and proposes branches; it is installed and configured globally (nix-managed
git config, rebase sync, `main` and `develop` perennial).

## Detect adoption first

Before any branch, PR, or release work, detect the repo's remote default
branch (`gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name`
or `git remote show origin`).

- Default branch `develop` → the repo is on git-flow; follow this file.
- Default branch `main` → trunk flow; keep the existing squash-to-main
  process and do **not** create a `develop` branch yourself.
- Never infer adoption from the current local branch name.

## The model

| Branch | Role | Gets changes by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main` | Production. Protected; no direct pushes. | **Merge commits only** — squash and rebase into `main` are banned, with no exceptions |
| `develop` | Default integration branch. Protected; no direct pushes. | Squash-merged PRs, including the release PR; a merge commit only for a PR from a hotfix branch |
| `feature/*` | One change's work | Branched from fresh `develop` |
| `hotfix/*` | Urgent production fix | Branched from `main`; PR to `main`, merge commit; then a PR from the hotfix branch (never `main`) to `develop`, merge commit |

`main` is never merged back into `develop`. Stabilization fixes land on `develop` through
ordinary PRs.

release-please keeps one release PR open against `develop` with the version bump, CHANGELOG and
release notes; every release PR auto-merges when its checks pass. The PR that opened the work owns the
release: confirm the release PR merged (merge it only if green and open), confirm `develop`'s head
checks are green, then promote. Later commits take the next version. The push to
`main` tags and releases that commit, already on `main`. Never merge to
`main` without intending a release.

Promotion is a merge-commit PR from `develop` to `main`. While a promotion PR is open,
nothing else merges into `develop` (the `release-freeze` status enforces it).

### Promotion is not done at the merge

Merging the promotion PR is step one of two. A promotion to `main` is
complete only when:

1. **The merge lands** (merge commit; release-please then tags the release commit).
2. **The major tag moves.** The release moves this repo's `vN` tag, so
   consumers that reference `@vN` (actions, reusable workflows), `?ref=vN`
   (flake inputs) or a `>=N,<N+1` range pick up the release with no bump PR.
   Verify the tag points at the release commit. Consumers' `flake.lock` files
   catch up in Renovate's weekend lock maintenance; nothing pushes into
   another repo. A breaking change ships as a new major (`vN+1`), which
   consumers adopt through their own Renovate PR.

Report a promotion as complete only with both done.

## Working a change

Before starting a change, check how far `develop` is ahead of `main`. Run
`git fetch origin`, then `git rev-list --count origin/main..origin/develop`. If the
number is 25 or more, do not start a new PR: promote `develop` to `main` first (or run
`/refresh-repo`). Start the change only when the number is below 25. `main` carries
only promotion merge commits that `develop` lacks, so its side of the count is not a
signal. This check applies to git-flow repos only; a trunk repo has no `develop`.

1. Create or switch to a fresh worktree based on `origin/develop`. Place it at
   the repo's top level as `.worktrees/<name>/` — beside the primary checkout,
   never nested inside it. Pass `git worktree add` an **absolute** destination
   path so the current directory cannot change where it lands, e.g.
   `git worktree add "$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)")/.worktrees/<name>" origin/develop`.
   A relative `.worktrees/<name>` resolves against your cwd — from inside the
   `main/` checkout it nests as `main/.worktrees/<name>`, which is wrong.
   `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` does not fix this: run from inside `main/`
   it returns `main/`'s own root, not the outer repo root — `--git-common-dir`
   is the anchor that stays stable across every worktree.
   Create `.worktrees/` if absent; keep it gitignored. The repo root checkout
   always stays on the default branch (`develop`, or `main` on trunk repos) —
   never check a feature branch out at the root.
2. Start the feature branch there with `git town hack <name>`, or let the
   harness worktree create it. Git Town fetches first and bases the branch on
   the fresh tip of `git-town.main-branch` (`develop` here). Branch names carry
   the session id (see the session-coordination rule): `<issue>-<sid8>-<slug>`,
   e.g. `git town hack 123-03a3a401-fix-inventory-loader`, and the
   worktree dir matches the name. This makes branch and worktree names unique
   per session — two sessions can never collide on either. Never invent an
   issue number; for issue-less maintenance drop that segment
   (`<sid8>-<slug>`). **One session, one branch**: never commit to or push
   another session's branch.
3. Commit **atomically**: one fix, one feature, or one coherent section of
   updates per commit — never a grab-bag. Follow Conventional Commits.
   Reference the issue (`#123`) in the commit or PR; use closing keywords
   (`fixes #123`) when the change closes it.
4. Open the PR against `develop`. **Squash-merge ordinary feature PRs.** Use a
   merge commit into `develop` only when preserving multiple atomic commits
   matters: stacked work, coordinated multi-commit changes, and hotfix
   branches.
5. Hotfix exception to PR targeting: a `hotfix/*` branch starts from `main`
   and its PR targets `main` (merge commit, never squash); afterward open a
   PR from the hotfix branch (not `main`) to `develop` and merge it with a
   merge commit.
6. **Every change to `develop` goes through a PR** — the org ruleset enforces
   it, so a direct push is rejected (`GH013: Repository rule violations`).
   Never plan a "quick direct commit" to `develop`; branch and open a PR.
7. **Merging**: The org `pr-automerge` workflow arms non-draft PRs without
   `human:review`, never a `develop` to `main` promotion. Agents never arm
   auto-merge; a draft or `human:review` holds a PR.

## Bot-owned files in rebases and merges

release-please owns `CHANGELOG.md` and its manifest files. When a rebase or
merge onto `develop` conflicts on a bot-owned file, always take the incoming
`develop` side (`git checkout --theirs <file>` during rebase) — never
hand-merge bot content, and never add a `merge=ours` gitattribute for it
(that silently discards release history). Squash your own commits into one
before rebasing across bot commits to cut the conflict surface.

## CI and automation on git-flow repos

- Required CI runs on `pull_request` targeting `develop` (and `main` for
  promotion PRs) and on `push` to `develop`. Release, tag, and production
  deploy workflows stay on `main`.
- Renovate dependency PRs target `develop` (the default branch). Do not add a
  repo-level `baseBranches` forcing `main`.

## Git Town usage

- **Start:** `git town hack <name>`. Never branch from a local `main` or
  `develop`; the agent hooks deny `checkout -b`, `switch -c` and a worktree add
  whose start point is not `origin/…`.
- **Sync:** `git town sync` rebases the branch onto the fresh parent and
  pushes with lease. Never merge the base into a PR branch: a merge commit
  fails the org's Conventional Commit ruleset.
- **Propose:** `git town propose` opens the PR against the parent.
- **Hotfix:** `git worktree add --no-track -b hotfix/<name> <abs-path> origin/main`.
- **Per-repo config:** a git-flow repo sets `git-town.main-branch=develop`
  (or commits `.git-branches.toml`); everything else comes from the global config.
