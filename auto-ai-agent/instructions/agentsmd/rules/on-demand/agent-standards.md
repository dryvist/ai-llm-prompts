# Agent and skill building standards

Apply these rules when building or revising agents, skills, tools, evaluations, or coding-agent briefs.
When building Dify workflows or configuring LiteLLM, also apply the [platform rules f–g](agent-standards-platform.md).
Treat the rules as authoring requirements; verify implementation and delivery separately.

## Sources

Resolve source IDs through the dated [authoring source table](agent-standards-sources.md) and
[platform source table](agent-standards-platform-sources.md). Local policy is identified separately from upstream requirements.
Memory guidance: Anthropic, *The components of agent memory*, published 2026-11-06. [A20]

## a. Agent definitions and prompts

- State the job, inputs, output schema, tools, completion criterion, and authority boundary. Separate project guidance from task instructions. [A4] [A5] [O7]
- Name the native workflow enforcing the [scheduling, branching, approval, and recovery boundary](agent-standards-platform.md#f-dify-agent-and-workflow-construction). [D3]
- Encode local conventions and costly gotchas; remove discoverable structure and default behavior. Re-evaluate instructions when changing models. [A1] [O1]
- Define focused roles with explicit tools, Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, and essential startup skills. [A5]
- Keep `CLAUDE.md` concise, scope specialized rules to files, and store learned context in memory. [A11]
- Give each learned or stored rule an evidence reference and a confirmed or unconfirmed status. Define who is authorized to correct or retire a wrong rule and how they check it against its source. [A20]
- Name one writer per source record in shared memory. Preserve key facts exactly: numbers, names, dates, and links. Concurrent writers append to their own records and never rewrite a shared summary (local write policy). [A20]
- Treat retrieval and writable memory as instruction inputs. Enforce source, destination, and network limits at runtime; keep preferences read-only. [A2]
- Retain per-source bookmarks and a delivery ledger. Preserve bookmarks after failed reads; report unavailable sources. [A2]
- Reconcile with the destination before retrying delivery. Record ambiguous delivery separately; advance bookmarks and ledger only after confirmed receipt. [A2]

## b. Skills: structure, descriptions, disclosure, scripts, tests

- Package YAML-frontmatter `SKILL.md` with optional `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/`; distribute the complete directory. [A15] [O3]
- Describe the task and exact triggers. Front-load distinguishing words and include exclusions that prevent false activation. [O1] [O3]
- Check description overlap with neighboring skills before paid execution trials; measure intended selection and sibling hijacking in the deployed catalog. [G1]
- Limit descriptions to 1,024 characters. Apply the separate local portability budget of 1,024 bytes and approximately 250-character soft target. [A15]
- Keep the body below the recommended 500 lines. Link references directly from `SKILL.md`; add navigation to long references. [A12]
- Keep prerequisites, authority limits, and stop conditions available when loaded alone; disclose optional detail progressively (local policy). [A12]
- Prefer instructions and existing native tools. Include executable resources only for warranted deterministic work; document dependencies and errors. [O3] [A12]
- Set invocation policy per harness: Claude `disable-model-invocation` and Codex `agents/openai.yaml`. Verify both behaviors. [A6] [O3]
- Test triggering and execution separately with positive and negative prompts. Compare outputs against no skill or the previous version. [O3] [A16]
- Reject revisions with no measured gain over the previous version; consider skills with no measured gain over no skill for retirement (local acceptance policy). [G1] [A3]
- Test the actual permitted target models and environments. Measure instruction changes for each target. [A12] [O1]

## c. Tool and MCP design

- Use consistent, discoverable action names, constrained input schemas, and structured outputs where supported. [A18]
- Describe purpose, applicability, parameters, results, and limitations in tool definitions; remove repeated system-prompt instructions. [A13] [A1]
- Filter and paginate results. Return actionable errors that support correction or identify blockers. [A18]
- Match tool granularity to client workflows; preserve composability and evaluate convenience tools on realistic tasks. [A18]
- Annotate read-only, destructive, idempotent, and open-world behavior accurately. Enforce access through permissions and scoped credentials. [A18] [A2]
- Test with an MCP client or Inspector, then evaluate realistic agent tasks through the interface. [A18]

## d. Evals

- Define measurable acceptance thresholds for correctness, privacy, latency, cost, and consequential failures before optimization. [A14]
- Sample production tasks and hard cases: malformed, ambiguous, oversized, unavailable-source, and negative-trigger inputs. [A14] [A3]
- Explain each hard case's intrinsic difficulty independently of current model failures; diagnose saturation, universal failures, and permitted model/effort scaling. [A3]
- Pair plan-only cases with authorized disposable sandbox execution; grade actual tool arguments, artifacts, and unauthorized effects separately. [G2]
- Preserve assistant-turn boundaries, parallel call batches, and instruction-injection timing; detect actions dispatched before loaded guidance arrives. [G2]
- Evaluate complete multi-turn sessions across handoffs; deduplicate repeated messages in ordered trajectories and retain the underlying traces. [C1]
- Check constrained outputs deterministically. Calibrate rubric judges against human-reviewed examples; keep judges distinct from candidates and blind to candidate identity. [A3] [F3]
- Randomize candidate/baseline order and check position bias; regrade identical outputs and report verdict disagreement. [A3]
- Repeat trials in clean environments. Separate model failures from timeouts, truncation, grader inconsistency, and stale state. [A3]
- Replay shared fixtures through existing direct-tool, controlled-loop, and installed-harness runners; locate guidance/tool-availability differences before editing instructions. [O8]
- Compare baselines and report uncertainty. Hold test cases outside optimizer context; reject gains within noise. [A3]
- Record dataset and prompt versions, model and evaluator configurations, and trace-linked results. Gate promotion on regression checks. [F1] [F2]
- Trace available skills, exact loaded versions, and loaded resource paths; link observations to the canonical skill revision without creating another source of truth. [F5]
- Continue sampled production evaluation; feed reviewed failures into datasets while protecting held-out answers. [F2] [F3] [A3]
