## Maintenance windows (shared hands-off flags)

Shared, agent-visible "hands-off" state for the homelab lives in **Vikunja**,
not the incident tracker. An incident/ticket object has no maintenance or
change concept, and a repurposed ticket is invisible to anything that would
query it. Vikunja is MCP-native both ways — `vikunja_projects` /
`vikunja_tasks` — so any agent reads and writes a window with one call.

Contract:

- One Vikunja project, **`Maintenance Windows`**. One task = one window.
- Task title = the affected host or service (FQDN, never an IP). `dueDate` =
  when the window ends. Apply the **`maintenance`** label. The description
  carries the reason and who or what opened it. Comments are the audit trail.
- **Before** non-trivial work on a live guest or service — converge, reboot,
  destroy/rebuild, or any disruptive infrastructure change — list open tasks
  in that project and check for an active window on that target. If one is open
  by someone else, treat it as hands-off and coordinate; do not barge in.
- **Open a window before you start** such work, and close it (or comment) when
  done. Reversible, local, read-only work needs no window.
- **Linking an incident**: cross-link by URL. Paste the incident ticket's URL
  into the window task's description, and the window task's URL back into the
  incident. No integration — a plain URL each way is enough to jump between
  them.
