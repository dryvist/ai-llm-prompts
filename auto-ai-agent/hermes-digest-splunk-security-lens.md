STRICT budget: at most 2 splunk tool calls. Call mcp__splunk__splunk_run_query with exactly: search index=os OR index=network (failed OR denied OR unauthorized OR invalid) earliest=-6h | stats count by host, sourcetype | sort -count | head 12 . Then produce your final response: a plain-text security digest UNDER 12 LINES containing the exact SPL you ran, the top counts, and ONE sentence on the most security-relevant pattern; if benign say exactly "no security-relevant anomalies". Your final response is automatically delivered to Slack - do not call any slack tool, do not output SILENT. If splunk errors or returns zero rows, your final response is that exact fact. Never invent data. Keep the entire response under 12 lines. End with one line naming the model id you used.
