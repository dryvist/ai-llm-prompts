# Automation

Prompts and reusable fragments for repository automation, cloud routines, and retired workflow references.

The cloud-routine bodies and their shared fragments were retired on 2026-08-06 when the
Anthropic cloud-routine substrate they ran on was decommissioned. They are kept here as
history, not as runnable prompts. Each retired entry's `source_history` note records where
its content went — Hermes jobs under `auto-ai-agent/`, an existing skill, or nowhere because
a native feature already covered it.
